cisco ios commands

# to get help, type a (partial )command and then hit '?'

# to see what is what
show inter status
# to look at vlans of an interface (fa0 are 100Mbit ports, gi0 for gigabit ports)
show run inter fa0/2
# to look at ports active on a specific vlan do
show vlan id 23

do show ip rout
do show run 
#  to grep through show commands, pipe to 'inc':
do show run | inc route

# to enter admin mode
enable

conf t  - configure from terminal

"show .. " statements dont work in management mode
unless you prefix them with "do ", in which case,
you don't get tab completion nor ?-help.

cisco vtp syncs vlans between switches

you need to "do wr" to save your changes across reboots

# you can access the different ports by port type
fa - FastEthernet,gi - GigabyteEthernet,te - TengigEthernet
swithcport mode  access/trunk
# "access" = "untagged"
# set pvid: 
switchport native vlan foo

# when you set vlans on a trunk switchport, you overwrite existing list unless you "add"
# example trunked port
inter gi0/48
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan add 10,23,130
descr d:mytrunk

# example of setting fa0/2 to only untagged vlan 130
inter fa0/2
switchport access vlan 130
# we have a port description convention, to make it easy to grok which port goes where,
# relative to layer 2; up means uplink, d means downlink, link means horizontal, srv means server port.
descr "srv:blah" / "u:blix" / "d:hsw6" / "l:hgw0"

# example of setting ports 1 through 16 to vlan 10
conf t
inter range gi0/1-16
switchport access vlan 10
spanning-tree portfast
end

# to save your work past reboots, you'll need to copy running to startup:
copy running-config startup-config
# equivalent to
do wr

### example confing ssh access on uplink trunk management vlan from scratch:
conf t
# set a hostname
hostname haus-magic-sw
# set up a username and password 
username nettlaug privilege 15 password 0 HausAdminPassword23
# create an admin vlan
vlan 23
name mgmt,hausmania
# enable ssh
ip ssh version 2
# generate host key
crypt generate rsa something something...
# set a vlan interface
interface Vlan 23
ip address 10.0.23.4 netmask 255.255.255.0
exit
# trunk vlan 23 to port 48
inter gi0/48
switchport mode trunk
switchport trunk allowed vlan add 23
