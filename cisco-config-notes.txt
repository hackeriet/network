cisco ios commands

# to get help, type a (partial )command and then hit '?'

# to see what is what
show inter status
# to look at vlans of an interface
show run inter fa0/2

do show ip rout
do show run 
#  to grep through show commands, pipe to 'inc':

# to enter admin mode
enable

conf t  - configure from status

"show .. " statements dont work in management mode
unless you prefix them with "do ", in which case,
you don't get tab completion nor ?-help.

to create a vlan with the cisco vlan ruter interface : "svi", do two things
1 - vlan 2 descr
2 - create router interface

cisco vtp syncs vlans between switches

# you can access the different ports by port type
fa - FastEthernet gi - GigabyteEthernet te - TengigEthernet
swithcport mode  access/trunk
# "access" = "untagged"
# set pvid: 
switchport native vlan foo

# when you set vlans on a trunk switchport, you overwrite existing list unless you "add"
switchport trunk allowed vlan add 130

# example of setting fa0/2 to only untagged vlan 130
conf t
inter fa0/2
switchport acces vlan 130
# we have a port description convention, to make it easy to grok which port goes where,
# relative to layer 2; up means uplink, d means downlink, link means horizontal, srv means server port.
descr "srv:blah" / "u:blix" / "d:hsw6" / "l:hgw0"

# to save your work past reboots, you'll need to copy running to startup:
copy running-config startup-config
